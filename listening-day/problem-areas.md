# From Themes and HMWs to Ideas and Use cases

## Derived Problem Areas

### Patient education and engagement (e.g. with clinicians, with health information)
e.g.
- HMW bridge gaps between clinicians and patients, to enable patients to better understand their health plans and create better adherence? (ideas - translations, literacy)
- HMW help patients better understand health information and improve health literacy? 

### Clinician education
e.g.
- HMW summarise literature of similar disease presentations with treatment guides to facilitate more rapid and informed decision making?

### Operational planning and demand predictions
e.g.
- HMW assimilate data from patient record and get it available to the bed-planners (prime social care)?
- HMW more efficiently document discharge summaries and clinical notes?
- HMW translate data (real-time or DWH) into actionable responses by consulting SOPs?
- HMW create Q&A interface to SOPs?
- HMW use data to make demand predictions and better allocate resources? 

### Data analyst/engineers knowledge base/education
e.g.
- HMW streamline the process that data analysts need to go through to understand e.g. 30 SOPs in order to release a study? (e.g onboarding)
- HMW enable engineers to more efficiently code and document coding?
- HMW make knowledge bases accessible and queryable for analysts?

### Clerical/administrative burden (e.g. payroll, pharmaceutical coding)
e.g.
 - HMW make administration of NHS payroll & other tasks more reliable and easier?
- HWM improve workflow of manually coding claims?

### Insights generation
e.g.
- HMW use LLMs to generate reports/insights from inputs?
- HMW create more dynamic reporting e.g. “what changed since last month”
- HMW quickly generate insights for execs for things they care about?
