## HMW statements - Long List
> Goal: Prioritise high-value + high-feasibility

1. HMW Use LLMs to make it easier for patients to understand information about their condition (e.g. ask NHS website to simplify or expand on explanation) 
2. HMW Use LLMs to make the process of writing discharge summaries and referrals quicker 
3. HMW Use LLMs to summarise a performance report. In particular, what has changed since last month’s report 
4. HMW Provide an LLM with local context. Can we provide it with local Trust website, docs, knowledge base, team manuals etc, so can ask specific local questions. 
5. HMW Use LLMs as a training tool / early feedback for sensitive conversations. E.g. help with phrasing / what questions a patient may have when being given a certain diagnosis. 
6. HMW Use CDS hooks to provide local guidance directly in the EHR 
7. HMW use historic patient data e.g. admissions, ambulance, call outs across an ICS to make demand projections that can affect resource decisions e.g. this time last year, this part of your ICS had high demand. 
8. HMW use LLMs to produce a summary/version of “their story”/patient history that people can share with clinicians where there is no shared patient data 
9. HMW Prioritisation of discharges through EHR - train model for Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and being out the most scalable result? 
10. HMW Combining clinical report to speech to text - RAG - check prescription - generate part - retrieval part
11. HMW evaluate the output of these models? Can we use models? 
12.  HMW keep LLMs up to date with changing regulation/policy? 
13. HMW recreate more “clinical-like” notes when LLMs not trained on this specific type of data? 
14. HMW create “human-like” error in synthetic data? 
15. HMW manage IG & cost constraints in operationalising LLMs in the NHS? 
16. HMW help manage operational aspects of hospitals such as load balancing, discharges etc? - Certain stakeholders - move into SOPs - decide? 
17. HMW help with decision making and SOPs? 
18. HMW help technical stack such as code documentation, education, etc. 
19. HMW Generating of insights for execs? - Dynamic reporting etc. 
20. HMW help with Inefficiencies - trust - with medicines used in hospitals - highly paid pharmacists - right cost centre - no good implementation of automating this - quite subjective - can’t codify - cardiology in HIV unit and use in another speciality - needs specialists to know what that is - specially trained model - this is what we use, where we typically see this - automate financial reporting to NHS England 
21. HMW Help patients interact with health data/ advice? E.g. translation, easier summarization - as doctor speaking - translate clinical notes that doctor is speaking - e.g. taking medications etc. - purely language. 
22. HMW consolidate info from multiple systems, enable building LLMs directly to query data? 
23. HMW help HR - resourcing, personal issues - around pay 
24. HMW support New starters - finding resources - NHS - complicated structure - e.g. data scientists with resources, who to speak to when setting up study, implementing model - cultural and institutional knowledge - extending that to help new starters - navigate new starter journey - lots of SOPS within org - differences region to region - train model to learn SOPs for technical tools - using - 1+1 all tools and SOPs - bring outputs and produce platform
25. HMW Collaboration and clinical context for technical analysts
26. HMW use LLMs to help collaboration - 
27. HMW make knowledge base accessible and queryable - enable analyst team. 
28. HMW Provide translation to other languages - use language in more convincing way - big chunk of NHS cost - preventable disease - chuck tablets in bin - fail because of not relating - both doctor and patient have problem - provide basic statement of take your pills - way that individual patient can query, interact with and believe - ties to input and output as voice rather than text - 
29. HMW use LLMs to upskill educational tools for analysts? GenAI as part of education tools? Not just watching videos - included in discussions 
30. HMW improve Dictation - to improve notes capture 
31. HMW help with translation and relating to patients - use video and voice, avatars - image of person you’re trying to relate to as well as language - visual and voice etc. - Inputs change - speech, facial expressions - individual interacting with model
32. HMW support doctor to patient - translation - analyst to manager - etc - don't look the part  help collaboration between analytical data scientist and manager - then look to extend that to patients and clinicians - 
33. HMW Prioritize discharge information to all relevant teams in a hospital / trust 
34. HMW Automate discharge letter writing 
35. HMW Analyse complains to identify themes in PALs teams 
36. HMW Notify social care providers in an ICS that a patient is ready to be discharged to a social care bed (& prompt social care to get a bed ready) 
37. HMW Standardize codes / ontologies / protocols to integrate systems 
38. HMW Capture data of what’s actually happening on the ground/frontline when it comes to interpreting data 
39. HMW Translation services using video / avatars to provide more relatable interactions to diverse patient groups 
40. HMW Get my patient to take their tablets by being more convincing 
41. HMW Identify frailty from subjective clinical data
42. HMW test our LLM applications and make them repeatable? 
43. HMW ensure the human in the loop makes decisions helped with live data about patients? 
44. HMW ensure synthetic data created by an LLM doesn't contain PII from real patients that might be in the training data? 
45. HMW remove identifiable information from patient experience feedback? 
46. HMW use LLMs to improve understanding/use of LLMs in the NHS? 
47. HMW build gaps and mistakes into the outputs if we want them to replicate the existing datasets? 
48. HMW - capture the feedback from end users that isn't written? Can we use something like a spoken summary of how things are being used - "I'm looking for the most viewed page" or "I'm skipping over this repeated sentence as I've seen the acronym x and know what it's referring to". 
49. HMW – use LLMs for coding like pharmacy cost codes, Incident categorisation? 
50. HMW democratise the use of LLMs in themselves. This hack has 
attracted people who are particular coders and don’t really represent the wider body of analysts so how do they include so they know what’s possible and don’t have to actually learn to use it? 
51. HMW support Operational management - where can we deploy the discharge technical got the right data in right time 
52. HMW use LLMs to self-diagnose coding issues and generate PRs -> human element can be an engineer review PR 
53. HMW use LLMs in predictive analysis to allocate resources 
54. HMW use LLMs in creating documentation for code repositories 
55. HMW use an LLM on top of futureNHS platform?
