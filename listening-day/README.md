### How Might We Statements

How Might We statements (HMWs) are a way of framing ideas without being prescriptive about the execution of that idea. They are a good place to begin generating ideas.

They should:
- Not be solutions
- Not be too broad or too narrow
- Try to Focus on desired outcome (e.g. feeling confident about results)
